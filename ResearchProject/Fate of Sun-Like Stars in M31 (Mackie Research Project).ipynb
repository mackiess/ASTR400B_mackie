    "## Main goal of code: \n",
    "\n",
    "### *To find out where disk stars at ~8 kpc in M31's disk end up after the MW/M31 merger*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Learn if M33's gravitational potential affects the stars in a way that MW suns weren't affected in van der Marel et al. 2012\n",
    "2. Find out if there is any structure to the change of positions of the stars\n",
    "3. **Focus of Assignment 3: Find out how many, if any, stars end up unbound/ how close candidate suns are to being unbound**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data needed for code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. At least MW snapshots 000, 801, and some in between\n",
    "2. At least M31 snapshots 000, 801, and some in between\n",
    "3. At least M33 snapshots 000, 801, and some in between\n",
    "\n",
    "**High res** or low res?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions needed to complete goal (not necessarily in order)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read in data from text file (ReadFile, HW2)\n",
    "2. Rotate M31 coords to view galaxy edge on in order to get in-plane velocity (Lab 7 Part B)\n",
    "3. Rotate M31 coords to view galaxy face on in order to better visualize \n",
    "3. Identify stars in M31_000.txt that fulfill the following conditions:\n",
    " - disk particle\n",
    " - distance within 10% of 8.34 kpc (Lec 4) from the COM (radius range aka RR = 7.506 kpc to 9.174 kpc)\n",
    " - in-plane velocity within 10% of the circular velocity of M31 in this radius range\n",
    " - out-of-plane velocity will be discounted for simplicity's sake? I want stable stars\n",
    "4. Calculate the total circular velocity at each radius within RR (CircularVelocityTotal, HW5)\n",
    "5. Calculate the total mass enclosed at each radius within RR (TotalMassEnclosed, HW5)\n",
    "6. Calculate the mass of a particular compoment at each radius within RR (MassEnclosed, HW5)\n",
    "7. Calculate the COM position and velocity of M31 (CLASS CenterOfMass, HW4)\n",
    "8. Calculate escape velocity for all candidate suns in their final positions (final snapshot tbd)\n",
    "9. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Potential plots\n",
    "\n",
    "1. # stars vs distance away from COM (histogram)\n",
    "2. **Focus of Assignment 3: # stars vs (total velocity/escape velocity)**\n",
    "2. Snapshot 000 vs 400 vs 801 (or more) with ring of interest highlighted (like Fig 5 of van der Marel et al. 2012)\n",
